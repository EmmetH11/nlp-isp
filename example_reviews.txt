We use this product daily in all of our hair, wet or dry. Not only has it made the hair shiny and smooth, but it has helped us through both several outbreaks of lice in the classroom. I have used this product for two years. First bottle bought on Amazon, one at target, and the rest Amazon purchases. We use a few sprays at night to brush out tangles and again in the morning. I bought the big bottle and fill little spray bottles for all five girls in my house (including me). It also has a pleasant rosemary scent that fades quickly if your not a rosemary fan
